# VIVERSE Multiplayer Integration

Add online multiplayer with VIVERSE Matchmaking + Play SDK for room lifecycle and in-game sync.

## When To Use This Skill

Use when a project needs:
- Online 2+ player rooms
- Create/join/start game flow
- Custom state sync (turn-based or real-time)
- Reliable rejoin/leave behavior between test sessions

## Read Order (Important)

1. This file (workflow + safety rules)
2. [patterns/matchmaking-flow.md](patterns/matchmaking-flow.md)
3. [patterns/move-sync-reliability.md](patterns/move-sync-reliability.md)
4. [examples/chess-move-sync.md](examples/chess-move-sync.md) for turn-based games

## Prerequisites

1. User authenticated (`checkAuth` success).
2. VIVERSE SDK loaded:
   ```html
   <script src="https://www.viverse.com/static-assets/viverse-sdk/index.umd.cjs"></script>
   <script src="https://www.viverse.com/static-assets/play-sdk/1.0.1/play-sdk.umd.js"></script>
   ```
3. App ID from [VIVERSE Studio](https://studio.viverse.com/).
4. Stable actor identity input (account id + per-connect unique suffix).

## Preflight Checklist

- [ ] `VITE_VIVERSE_CLIENT_ID` matches target app
- [ ] User auth is valid (has account id/token)
- [ ] SDK namespace checked with `window.viverse || window.VIVERSE_SDK`
- [ ] Play SDK namespace fallback checked (`window.play` / `window.Play`) for MultiplayerClient
- [ ] You have cleanup logic for stale rooms
- [ ] You have fallback sync path (room properties) if messages drop

## Implementation Workflow

### 1) Init Play + Matchmaking

```javascript
const v = window.viverse || window.VIVERSE_SDK;
const PlayClass = v.Play || v.play || window.play?.Play || window.play?.play || window.Play;
globalThis.playClient = new PlayClass();
globalThis.matchmakingClient = await playClient.newMatchmakingClient(appId);
```

### 2) Wait for connect, then set actor

```javascript
matchmakingClient.on("onConnect", async () => {
  await matchmakingClient.setActor({
    session_id: actorSessionId, // recommended: account-based + per-connect suffix
    name: user.displayName,
    properties: {},
  });
});
```

### 3) Create or join room

```javascript
const room = await matchmakingClient.createRoom({
  name: "My Game Room",
  mode: "Room",
  maxPlayers: 2,
  minPlayers: 2,
  properties: {}
});

const joined = await matchmakingClient.joinRoom(roomId);
```

Handle both response shapes:
- `{ room }`
- `{ success, message, room }`

### 4) Start game (host only)

```javascript
await matchmakingClient.startGame();
```

Joiner side listens for `onGameStartNotify`.

### 5) Init MultiplayerClient for sync

```javascript
const MClient =
  (v?.play || v?.Play)?.MultiplayerClient ||
  window.play?.MultiplayerClient ||
  window.Play?.MultiplayerClient;
const mp = new MClient(roomId, appId, userSessionId);
await mp.init({ modules: { general: { enabled: true } } });
```

Register listeners before/around init when possible, then bridge both receive channels.

### 6) Send and receive messages

```javascript
mp.general.sendMessage(JSON.stringify({ type: "fen", fen: chess.fen() }));

mp.general.onMessage((raw) => {
  const data = typeof raw === "object" ? raw : JSON.parse(raw);
  if (data.type === "fen") chess.load(data.fen);
});
```

For turn-based games, send full state snapshots (for example FEN), not deltas.

## Room Lifecycle Best Practice

Before create/join in repeated tests:

1. Disconnect multiplayer client
2. If host, close room
3. Leave room
4. Disconnect matchmaking
5. Re-init and set actor again

This prevents stale-room rebinding and "game already started" failures.

### Lobby UX requirements (must-have)

- Show a dedicated `Leave Room` button whenever user is inside a room (host and joiner).
- `Back` should run full lifecycle cleanup; `Leave Room` should leave current room but keep matchmaking connected.
- Host leave order must remain:
  1. disconnect multiplayer
  2. close room
  3. leave room
- Joiner leave order must remain:
  1. disconnect multiplayer
  2. leave room
- After leave/create/join failure, refresh room list immediately to remove stale or not-joinable entries from UI.
- Block `Start Match` until room has required player count (for 1v1, `2/2`).

### Mobile lifecycle + zombie-session prevention

- Treat `visibilitychange` / `pagehide` as lifecycle events:
  - if app is backgrounded in active session for too long (for example >10s), return to lobby and run cleanup.
  - on `pagehide`, best-effort call multiplayer lifecycle cleanup.
- Add in-game heartbeat messages from both peers (for example every 2s).
- Host tracks peer heartbeat timeout (for example 12s):
  - if timed out, terminate session gracefully and clean room.
- Handle WebGL context loss (`webglcontextlost`) on mobile resume:
  - trigger session interruption flow and return to lobby rather than keeping a broken white screen.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Two different users can create/join/start
- [ ] Both sides receive game-start signal
- [ ] Host leave closes room for joiners
- [ ] Joiner leave does not break host's ability to restart
- [ ] Move/state sync works for first move and late joiner catch-up
- [ ] No stale room is auto-rejoined after cleanup

## Critical Gotchas

- `setActor` must run after matchmaking connect.
- If `Start Match` fails with `Multiplayer SDK missing`, Play SDK namespace resolution is incomplete; check both `window.viverse` and `window.play/window.Play` and ensure play-sdk script is loaded.
- Register/start handlers before calling `startGame` to avoid missed events.
- Use `mp.general.sendMessage(...)` with bound context; avoid detached fn refs.
- Bridge both `mp.onMessage` and `mp.general.onMessage` in mixed environments.
- Compute and send sync payload before React async state updates.
- Use room-properties fallback (`setRoomProperties/getAvailableRooms`) when websocket delivery is inconsistent.
- Host leave order matters: disconnect multiplayer -> close room -> leave room.
- Reuse of fixed session id can cause stale room rebinding; use fresh per-connect id.
